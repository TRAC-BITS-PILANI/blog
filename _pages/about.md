Hey, we're TRAC BITS Pilani! We are a group of radio astronomy enthusiasts who work on a variety of problems in a diverse field of topics. As science gets interconnected across the world, we look to apply physics, signal processing and machine learning to the treasure trove of observational data collected by the finest telescopes across the world. The marriage of these fields results in a truly unique combination of applied research. We're currently working on projects related to the Sky Watch Array Network Project by the RRI, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and on Software Defined Radio. We hope to bring a slice of these fascinating topics to you in this blog. We hope you have a wild ride!
