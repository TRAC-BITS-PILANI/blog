            "title": "Crisis Averted : Rescuing Apollo 11",
            "content": "This article is the first in a two part series about how the Apollo 11 and Apollo 14 missions suffered serious setbacks in their computers which were fixed on the fly, allowing both missions to proceed without further mishaps. . After a decade of training, the time had come. The Apollo 11 mission would be the first time man set foot on the moon. The weight of a planet rested on the shoulders of three men - Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins. Much like the pilots of airplanes, the module was also on autopilot for most of the journey. The trusty computer had taken them over three hundred thousand kilometers of nothingness. After four days of being stuck in a capsule with no one else, they were reaching their destination. Armstrong and Aldrin now switched seats for the next part of the plan, while Collins would remain in the orbiter. Their lunar descent module detached from the orbiter just over a hundred kilometers from the surface of the moon. Again, it was the refrigerator-sized box with less power than a cell phone that would be responsible for putting Homo sapiens on the moon. Or would it? . You’re still orbiting the planet, so the first task to descend would be to kill your horizontal velocity to a more controllable number. You push the buttons to initiate the descent procedure, and your computer kicks into action. It’s time to run the PDI routine. The engine starts slowing you down, and you’re good. The computer throws in code 500 - the antenna was out of position. It seems to be fine; you check it anyway and clear the warning. . . Phases of the Lunar Landing1 | . You’re no longer orbiting. You will be hurtling towards the surface of a rocky, dusty world. Landings require a massive effort from the pilots to put the craft safely on the ground. Luckily for you, you are among the best, and you’re watching over this silicon circuitry to place you down. The chip works down the BURNBABY routine. The propellant flowed, the engine fired. . You need to know your position and velocity to make a safe landing on the lunar surface. This part is straightforward, the radar gives you the data. Both yourself and mission control approve it, and you can carry on. You ask the computer to calculate the height difference between the computed and actual altitude. VERB 16 NOUN 68. It tells you that the error is 2900 feet, which is reasonable. What was not reasonable is the ringing in your earpiece. Not good. . What could the error possibly be? You try to switch the screens to find out. VERB 5 NOUN 9. . “It’s a 1202. What is that? Give us a reading on the 1202 Program Alarm.” You have numerous hours of training for multiple scenarios that could have happened on the mission. Neither you nor the commander, Neil Armstrong, have an inkling about what this error means. . 30 long seconds pass. Mission control gets back to you saying it’s all good, make the landing. Ok, maybe that was a non-event. Let’s get the difference again. 900 feet. Should be good? Not so fast! The computer crashes again with the same error code. Mission Control gives the go signal again. You’ve dropped six kilometers in this craziness. You’ve been trained to remain calm, and so you will. . 600 meters from the surface. A 1201 alarm. 24 more seconds. A 1202 alarm. Mission control seems nonchalant about this and lets you proceed. 16 more seconds. Another 1202. . . An overview of the landing site2 | . Your commander has had enough. This man has fought for the Navy in Korea. He’s rescued the Gemini 8 while it was spinning in space. He switched the autopilot into ATT HOLD, which instructed to computer to hold elevation while he would pilot the craft manually. This eased up on the computational load and no more alarms sounded. Up close, the surface was a mess. Rubble on the ground would mean the landing might be harsh… Not anymore. Armstrong put the vehicle on the dust, kicking it up. A tiny bounce and your craft lands safely on the ground, to a perfect halt. The agony was done. . Far from it. Many miles away, MIT housed the brains behind the Apollo Guidance Computer. Hal Lanning was the mastermind behind the programming paradigm for the Apollo computer. Multiple processes would have to be simultaneously run, but there was a single processor available. Laning hacked his way around this by assigning every job a priority number. Guidance and control of the craft would be low priority processes always in the background, while requests by astronauts would be the higher priority ones. With the paradigm in their hands, the responsibility of programming fell to Charles Muntz. He determined that there was a possibility that when flooded with commands, the system might get overwhelmed. To prevent adverse effects, the computer would then save a copy of everything going on right then in a checkpoint of sorts and restart. On returning to life, it only reopens essential processes. The processes themselves, consisted of VERBs and NOUNs, to tell the computer what to do. VERBs, much like English, were action commands while NOUNs requested a specific token. . . Lunar Module Display and Keyboard Unit (DSKY)1 | . If a copy of variables had to be saved when a higher priority process had to be run, the executive function allotted some space. Vector and matrix calculations need a lot of space, so the lunar guidance computer housed five vector accumulator areas (VACs). The highly restricted amount of computational power meant upto eight jobs could stay in the queue at any point of time and only five of them could use the VACs. The backup system when this system gets overwhelmed is highly necessary to prevent disaster. If the executive function ran out of slots in the queue, then it issued error code 1202, while it issued 1201 when it ran out of VAC slots. It would then run BAILOUT, which would restart the system. . Don Eyles was the man who worked on programming the final descent. To him, this situation was never good. The guidance used 87% of computation until this moment while Aldrin’s request added another 3%. The remaining computation power was being used by a mystery process. As the craft approached the surface, guidance would want more computation power, and the process wouldn’t give up the space causing the system to crash multiple times. . Back on Earth, the MIT team found the mystery process. The Lunar Module which made its way to the surface would eventually have to go back and link up with the Command Module in orbit with Collins. The instrument responsible for getting them to meet was the rendezvous radar. This radar would measure the range and range-rate of the other craft and was also backed up when the abort guidance system kicked in. The radar was hooked into the attitude control system. This system was frequency-locked with the guidance computer which was good. But the signals were out of phase because the guidance computer powered up after the control system. The unit coupling the data from the radar with the guidance computer began to increment and decrement counters in the guidance computer when it got contradicting signals which was the mystery process eating up the CPU. Armstrong and Aldrin switched the mode of the radar to the right position and blasted off into lunar orbit. Three days later, they splashed down on the Pacific and the rest is history. . .

            "title": "Adding a Webb of Eyes",
            "content": "Humans have always looked up to the sky and wondered. This expanse is so large; it is impossible to comprehend it. Our neighbor, Mars, is so far away that if anyone were to ping us with any information, there would be a 12-minute delay before receiving the message. And the diameter of the observable Universe? Let’s just leave it by stating that it is 92 billion light-years. While we are born too late to explore our planet but too early to explore the vast expanse above, we can chip in by helping our successors. The James Webb Space Telescope is a brand new eye scheduled to be launched on 31st October. . . The James Webb Space Telescope1 | . Predated by two of the great observatories, the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, the Webb is primarily an infrared telescope. Why infrared? Ever since it was born, the Universe has been sucking up the nothing and making it something. It has been expanding at an ever-accelerating rate. Our best estimates for the age of the Universe is 13 billion years, which means the radius must also be 13 billion years, seemingly contradicting my sentence above. However, the light from distant galaxies is redshifted. The furthest reaches of the galaxy emit cosmic microwave background radiation that has been shifted to that end of the spectrum. This gives us the best estimate of the size of our Universe as far as we can see. However, the furthest galaxies contend themselves with the infrared. Our telescope aims to listen in to exactly this range, helping us advance our understanding of the Universe in its infancy and about the earliest galaxies. . . We are embedded in shells of cosmic time1 | . Focussing on infrared radiation allows another advantage that telescopes in the visible region don’t have. Space has a large amount of cosmic dust and massive gas clouds. These particles scatter visible light that hits them, and hence light from these regions isn’t particularly clear. Infrared light doesn’t get scattered as easily and thus can be studied in much more detail. The Spitzer Space Telescope helped highlight this somewhat untapped potential for distant observation. Infrared telescopes can also help us better study dimmer objects such as those in our Kuiper belt or exoplanetary systems. . The primary mirror of the JWST is a large array of 18 hexagonal beryllium reflectors plated with gold 6.5 meters wide. It will unfold after the telescope is launched. The JWST uses the three-mirror anastigmat, an innovative technique to reduce aberration, a primary concern for large telescopes. The huge mirror is supplemented by a host of scientific instruments for imaging in the infrared and spectroscopic analysis under the name “Integrated Science Instrument Module.” It supplies electrical and computation power and offers structural stability to the craft. . . The Primary Mirror of the JWST1 | . The final module is the Spacecraft Bus, which houses the central processor and relays information to and from our planet. The spacecraft bus faces the sun and operates at a temperature of 300 K. You might recall that infrared radiation corresponds to hot objects. If we have a hot spacecraft, we have infrared radiation from it. This would mean radiation from the craft would mess with the craft’s observations. The issue is solved elegantly with a small loophole in celestial mechanics. . . Lagrange Points1 | . The three-body problem allows for 5 points around two large bodies where the large bodies’ gravitational influence cancels. At these locations, called Lagrange points, a small object can be placed in orbit around nothing. This is known as a “Halo orbit.” Jupiter, being the largest body in our solar system not called the Sun has a large gravitational influence on its surroundings. As a result, it often captures a lot of asteroids from the belt adjacent to it. These asteroids sit in the Lagrange points of Jupiter’s orbit for a while rather than making their way near our planet and being a little more annoying than a global pandemic. Back to our craft, its orientation is maintained in this location, and the sun-facing side faces nothing but the sun. The mirror side is protected by a five-layered sun shield, which blocks surrounding light and heat. The result is that the telescope ends up at around 50 K, ideal for infrared observations. However, the L2 orbit where the JWST will be placed is metastable, requiring occasional thruster burns to position it accurately. It is a brilliant location, not too far, but close enough to capture some truly stunning images. . There is a vast world out there. All it needs is an ear to listen and an eye to see. .

            "title": "Journey Through Quantum Universe and the “Stringy” String Theory",
            "content": "If movies and shows like Antman, Interstellar, and Quantum Leap intrigue you about dimensions, quantum world, and dark matter, then you will be in for a ride. . Quantum physics is usually described as the science of the very small-electrons, atoms, photons- all far smaller than the objects in our everyday lives. However, this does not mean that we can forget the quantum’s impact as we look to the universe and take in its cosmological implications. . Cosmic Quantum Theory . Ever wondered why it seems strange that quantum particles behave the way they do. So different from familiar objects, even though those objects are made up entirely of quantum particles. Yet, we can’t escape quantum effects, even on a macro scale. . When we look beyond the earth to the broader universe and consider a very large phenomenon, we can’t put quantum physics aside. Although gravity is the most significant force on the astronomical scale, the other three fundamental forces have essential roles to play, whether in the nuclear reactions of a star or the electromagnetic pulses that blast out from solar flares. Quantum effects also crop up in several theoretical concepts, such as black holes and the big bang. . . A quantum effect (a conceptual visualization), Source | . Black Holes . Stars naturally collapse under the pull of gravity- it’s how they were formed; from a cloud of gas in the first place. But as they collapse, they heat up and the heat energy, which causes the atoms to jostle around, eventually balances out the collapse. One of the first deductions from the general theory of relativity was that as stars run out of energy, some will start to collapse again, getting smaller until they disappear to a point. . This results in a singularity. Also because general relativity shows that matter produces a warp in space-time that results in the effects of gravity, get close enough to a black hole and the warping is so severe that nothing, not even light, can escape. The sphere within which this occurs is known as the “event horizon”. . . A black hole and its components, Source | . Visible Blackness . Although nothing gets out of black holes, they still give off radiation. Any nearby material that is pulled into them will accelerate, emitting photons as they do so. And there will be a glow from a process known as Hawking radiation, in which pairs of quantum particles pop into existence as a result of the uncertainty principle. The event horizon splits them, one of which recedes into the black hole, and the other is the radiation which we can pick up. . . A black hole (illustrative concept), Source | . String Theory . String theory was first developed in an attempt to explain the standard model of particle theory. Extended to take in gravitational effects, it has become the most widely researched attempt to link quantum physics and gravity. . When described, string theory seems beguilingly attractive. Each particle is just a different mode of vibration of the one real fundamental particle-the string. This is a one-dimensional construct that can be either open or formed into a loop, which vibrates differently. . However, this theory only works if there are 26 spatial dimensions! Also, the problem we face while studying this theory is that the equations don’t have a single solution - they have about 10500 solutions, an unfathomably large number. . Many Dimensions . In quantum physics, it is not unusual to consider an artificial multidimensional space where each dimension is the equivalent of one possible outcome or a different variable in an equation. . Envisaging a fourth spatial dimension is not too difficult. We can imagine the possibility of having a finite universe with no boundaries. And if the universe were folded through a fourth dimension, we needn’t have the complexity of an edge. . But to get around string theory as mentioned above (containing nine dimensions), the unseen dimensions are assumed to be curled up in such tight loops that we cannot detect them. . . Imagining the string theory(spatial dimension), Source | . M-Theory . When combined, the five major variants of string theory form the single approach known as M-theory, which American physicist Edward Witten introduced in 1995. . In M-theory, the basic unit, rather than a string, is a brane, with any number of dimensions up to ten. Interestingly the extra dimensions in M-theory are quite different from the science-fiction concept of a “parallel dimension”, which is more like an alternative universe alongside our own. But the extra dimensions in M-theory are just the same kind of dimensions as the ones we currently experience, which means they have to be modified in some way to explain their apparent absence. . Talking more about branes: in M-theory, our universe can be represented by a membrane (brane) floating in 10D space. An alternative to the conventional big bang theory called “Ekpyrotic theory” suggests that the universe began expanding when two of these branes collided. . . A schematic diagram of the M-theory, Source | . Loop Quantum Gravity . The greatest challenge to string theory is loop quantum gravity. This doesn’t require the extra dimensions and doesn’t see the string as a super particle. Instead, loop quantum gravity breaks down space-time itself into a kind of a particle. . Loops are not well defined and are fuzzy clouds of probability. Once the quantum theory is applied to space-time, the uncertainty principle comes into play. Here instead of momentum and position, an equivalent pairing would be an area of space and its curvature. . Let’s take a sheet of rubber as an analogy for space-time in general relativity, as this requires space and time to be warped, somewhat like how a sheet of rubber distorts when a heavy object is placed on it. The equivalent analogy for loop quantum gravity is a weave of loops. . But the weave of loops is space-time (or, more precisely, space, because time is an added extra in this theory!). Empty space would still have loops, while a region with no loops would contain no space. . . Conceptual visualization of Loop Quantum gravity, Source | . Considering all theories and the loopholes in them, we need to consider that there shouldn’t be a single approach covering everything, rather all our experiences seem to suggest in the future we may reach a more universal view. . Whatever the final outcome, quantum theory has proved superbly accurate in describing the behavior of matter and light, and it will continue to enable us to produce remarkable new technologies for centuries to come. .",

            "title": "Charting the Skies",
            "content": "Humanity’s obsession to archive everything they know has existed from time immemorial. When it comes to the skies, humanity has been making star catalogs dating back to 190 BCE. The birth of astrometry as a science dates back to this era. Astrometry, put very simply, deals with the kinematics of celestial bodies. The Greeks played a large role in ancient astrometry. Their catalogs listed out coordinates and motions of some of the brighter objects in the sky. One of the oldest catalogs dates back to Timocharis and Aristillus, which Hipparchus used to determine that the Earth was not just spinning but also precessing. Hipparchus went ahead and cataloged around 800 stars, to which his successor, Ptolemy, added more and published a very accurate list in his treatise, the Almagest. . . Ptolemy’s Amalgest1 | . Fast forward to the next largest leap in astrometry, to the 15th century. The Danish nobleman, Tyge Ottesen Brahe, more commonly known as Tycho Brahe, was one of the best observational astronomers of this time. He made exact measurements of many objects in the sky, all of which he meticulously listed. This is even more stunning when you consider telescopes have still not been invented. Tycho Brahe was the last great astronomer to work without a telescope. He did, however, use a rather quaint instrument called a mural quadrant. It is essentially a large half protractor, which enabled him to mark out positions of celestial objects very accuratelys. On the one hand, you have all this brilliant data. On the other, you have this very jealous apprentice who was thirsty for more. He felt his advance in society was being blocked by this powerful nobleman. A dose of mercury in his banquet supper and Brahe was no more. Kepler took all of Brahe’s data and proposed the famous laws of planetary motion. . . A Mural Quadrant1 | . Let’s take a short interlude and discuss how we mark out positions in the sky. From our position on Earth, regardless of your exact position, we can see a hemisphere of the sky. Combined with the hemisphere on the opposite position on the Earth, we have the celestial sphere. Immediately, this suggests a coordinate system to chart out the skies. We can modify the spherical coordinate system to fit our needs. We call this the equatorial coordinate system. We can not fix an axis, because as we previously saw, the Earth precesses. So we take a standard date, known as an epoch, to set the axis’s position at that date. We are currently in the J2000.0 epoch. After fixing a reference axis, it is straightforward to mark out objects. The right ascension is the celestial equivalent of geographical longitude, while the declination is the equivalent of geographical latitude. The GIF below shows how it works. . . An explanation for Right Ascension and Declination1 | . Close to the turn of the 16th century, Hans Lippershey submitted a patent for a device that can be used “for seeing things far away as if they were nearby”. And it was this device that continues to be used to date, known as the telescope. Ratified in design by Galileo Galilei, Sir Issac Newton, and Laurent Cassegrain, this is the instrument that revolutionized observational astronomy. And it was not just the visible spectrum. When other types of electromagnetic radiation were discovered, it didn’t take too long to see that there were extraterrestrial sources of these radiation as well. Soon came a range of telescopes covering the entire spectrum, from the lengths of the radio and infrared all the way to X-ray and even gamma ray telescopes. . Let’s take another interlude to explain the concept of parallax. Parallax is the difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight. A quick demonstration is when you close either eye and notice that the images are different. Different orbital positions of the Earth cause some confusion in measurements, but it can very simply be resolved when you factor in parallax. Parallax is so vital to our understanding of the motion of objects in the sky; we often take measurements of celestial objects when we are at opposite ends of the Earth’s orbit to determine the body’s distance along with its position. . . An intuition for Parallax1 | . Parallax measurements were tough before you made this leap in understanding. And indeed, the first attempt to measure stellar parallaxes in 1729 by James Bradley failed. He did discover two important things - that the Earth rotates in the other Euler angle as well - so it nutates in addition to precession and spin. The other was that telescopes suffer from aberration, and corrections will need to be made to observations to account for this. In 1807, Friedrich Bessel refined Bradley’s catalog of around 3000 stars and made the first successful measurement of stellar parallax. . By the end of the 19th century, humanity only knew 60 stellar parallaxes because of the difficulty to measure them. Photographic plates helped us make the next leap, and in the early 20th century, we had astrographs, which essentially gave us pictures of the sky. With the rapid advancement in technology, we had computers on the job as well. The project Carte du Ciel (French for Sky’s card) helped make a pipeline of sorts for how sky mapping could be done. This opened the floodgates, made astrometry much less expensive, and opened the field to everyone. . In 1968, observations of the sky left our planet for the first time, with NASA’s OAO-2. The Soviets launched the Salyut missions soon after. In 1989, astrometrical missions took the skies with ESA’s Hipparchus satellite being launched to orbit, with the sole purpose of improving our catalogs. During its four year run, it measured the properties of over a hundred thousand stars. Recognizing the need to have an accurate measure of even more objects, the ESA sent another satellite, the Gaia mission, in 2013. It improved on the precision of Hipparchus by a magnitude of 100 and cataloged a billion stars. We now have numerous satellites looking around in the sky, looking to measure everything we can see to expand our understanding. .
