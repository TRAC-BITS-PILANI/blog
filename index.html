Welcome to the blog of TRAC BITS Pilani! We are a group of astronomy enthusiasts. No, not your average Joe who stares at the sky. We use the cooler radio part of the spectrum for our observation. Galaxies are our stars in this world. Among all frequency bands in the spectrum, radio has the clearest reception on ground because its absorbed and scattered the least. This presents a goldmine of information for us to study about. We also work on multiple other global projects like SWAN Project (Sky Watch Array Network), LIGO Project (Laser Interferometer and Gravitational Observatory) and the SDR Project (Software Defined Radio). This is a collection of blog posts based on all of our work. We hope to present the deeper essence behind ML and DSP to you and we promise it will most certainly be better than your PS :P
