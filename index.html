Welcome to the blog of TRAC BITS Pilani! We are a group of astronomy enthusiasts. No, not your average Joe who stares at the sky. We use the cooler radio part of the spectrum for our observation. Galaxies look like stars in this world and reception is among the clearest for all bands here. We also work on multiple other global projects like SWAN Project (Sky Watch Array Network), LIGO Project (Laser Interferometer and Gravitational Observatory) and the SDR Project (Software Defined Radio). This is a collection of blog posts based on all of our work. We hope you enjoy reading them!
