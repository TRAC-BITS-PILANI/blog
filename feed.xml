This expanse is so large; it is impossible to comprehend it. Our neighbor, Mars, is so far away that if anyone were to ping us with any information, there would be a 12-minute delay before receiving the message. And the diameter of the observable Universe? Let’s just leave it by stating that it is 92 billion light-years. While we are born too late to explore our planet but too early to explore the vast expanse above, we can chip in by helping our successors. The James Webb Space Telescope is a brand new eye scheduled to be launched on 31st October.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Journey Through Quantum Universe and the “Stringy” String Theory</title><link href="https://trac-bits-pilani.github.io/blog/string%20theory/quantum%20gravity/black%20holes/2021/07/21/String-Theory.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Journey Through Quantum Universe and the “Stringy” String Theory" /><published>2021-07-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-07-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://trac-bits-pilani.github.io/blog/string%20theory/quantum%20gravity/black%20holes/2021/07/21/String-Theory</id><author><name></name></author><category term="String Theory" /><category term="Quantum Gravity" /><category term="Black Holes" /><summary type="html">If movies and shows like Antman, Interstellar, and Quantum Leap intrigue you about dimensions, quantum world, and dark matter, then you will be in for a ride.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Charting the Skies</title><link href="https://trac-bits-pilani.github.io/blog/astrometry/ptolemy/celestial/coordinates/parallax/2021/07/20/Astrometry.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Charting the Skies" /><published>2021-07-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-07-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://trac-bits-pilani.github.io/blog/astrometry/ptolemy/celestial/coordinates/parallax/2021/07/20/Astrometry</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Astrometry" /><category term="Ptolemy" /><category term="Celestial" /><category term="Coordinates" /><category term="Parallax" /><summary type="html">Humanity’s obsession to archive everything they know has existed from time immemorial. When it comes to the skies, humanity has been making star catalogs dating back to 190 BCE. The Greeks played a large role in ancient astronomy. One of the oldest catalogs dates back to Timocharis and Aristillus, which Hipparchus used to determine that the Earth was actually precessing and not just spinning. Hipparchus went ahead and cataloged around 800 stars, to which his successor, Ptolemy, added more and published a very accurate list in his treatise, the Almagest.</summary></entry></feed>
